            This study analyzes conceptual differences between 
            two well-known software development models, Scrum 
            and Waterfall (e.g. agile, and non-agile) as a 
            foundation to compare employee job satisfaction. 
            Current research supports the general claim that 
            agile software development processes are related 
            to higher job satisfaction than non-agile processes.
            Hypotheses proposing differences in five aspects of 
            job satisfaction (creativity, job security, social 
            status, authority, and responsibility) between the
            two process models are empirically tested. A sample
            of 52 software professionals experienced with both 
            process models was collected for this study. Results
            show that even though the general perception of Scrum
            is positive, a more differentiated analysis of satisfaction with responsibility, job security, and social status does not offer the same definite answer. Results show that managers are significantly more satisfied with their authority in Waterfall than in Scrum. This highlights the need for differentiated theoretical arguments regarding project management process structures and their influence on various performance criteria.
